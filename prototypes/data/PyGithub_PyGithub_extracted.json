One consequence of this is that mypy will not recognize that this method exists.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds that missing stub. There is no \"code change\" per se.\r\n\r\nThe types I chose for the arguments and the return type match what is documented on the [method docstring](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/blob/master/github/GitRelease.py#L275), and from a cursory read through, appear to match what the code itself requires.\r\n\r\nThe only interesting one was the `file_like` argument. Our docstring is perhaps a little restrictive in asking for an object that [\"must implement `read()`\"](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/blob/v1.54.1/github/GitRelease.py#L278) because this object [is later used](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/blob/v1.54.1/github/Requester.py#L108) by the requests library, which has a much broader requirement of a [\"Dictionary, list of tuples, bytes, or file-like object to send\"](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/v2.25.1/requests/sessions.py#L481).\r\n\r\nWithout wanting to expand the scope of this PR too much, I chose to stick to file-like objects as the docstring asks for. This type could be summed up as `IO[Any]`. My reference for that comes from noting how this argument is passed by PyGithub to requests, which passes it to urllib3, which passes it to `http.client`, which finally has a [typeshed stub](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/stdlib/http/client.pyi#L166) describing the argument as [`Union[bytes, IO[Any], Iterable[bytes], str]`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/stdlib/http/client.pyi#L26). The `IO[Any]` one seems to fit best.\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure how to test stubs... But here's one method that might be sufficient:\r\n\r\n1. Save this code to `foo.py`:\r\n    ```python\r\n    from pathlib import Path\r\n    from github import Github\r\n    \r\n    gh = Github(login_or_token=\"api_token\")\r\n    repo = gh.get_repo(\"user/repo\")\r\n    release = repo.get_release(\"some release\")\r\n    \r\n    asset_path = Path(\"./foo.txt\")\r\n    \r\n    with asset_path.open(\"rb\") as asset_file:\r\n        release.upload_asset_from_memory(\r\n            file_like=asset_file,\r\n            file_size=asset_path.stat().st_size,\r\n            name=\"foo\"\r\n        )\r\n    ```\r\n2. Run `mypy foo.py` and note the error `error: \"GitRelease\" has no attribute \"upload_asset_from_memory\"`\r\n3. Apply this patch, run mypy again, and see how the error is gone.",

This means the following code block will never again notice the place of the `_initAttributes` and fails at the end of the file due to endless loop.\r\n\r\nProblem can be fixed by conditionally remembering we already reached the `_initAttributes` function, so replace:\r\nhttps://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/blob/34d097ce473601624722b90fc5d0396011dd3acb/scripts/add_attribute.py#L122\r\n\r\nwith\r\n\r\n```python\r\ninInit = True if line == \"    def _initAttributes(self):\" else False\r\n```",

Any idea what I can use to test downloading artifacts?\r\n\r\nThings to review/consider:\r\n- Following the status \"302 Found\" redirect, needed during the download of artifacts, is handled manually, since existing tests break when adding this to `Requester.__requestRaw` (see @JacekPliszka's f69c763, and my a7fd8f2). Is this something that should be preferably be added to `Requester.__requestRaw`? I can do an effort to fix those failing tests, then.\r\n- I had to refactor the methods of `Requester` quite a bit, in order to be able to download a binary file without trying to decode it to a unicode string.

I originally found this while using <https://github.com/karlicoss/ghexport/issues/4>, you can see the process of debugging it in that issue.\r\n\r\nI've debugged this quite a bit in the above issue, created <https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/pygithub_requests_error> which has code that runs in a virtualenv which causes the error *on my machine*. Strangely, @karlicoss, who I debugged this with doesn't have the same error.\r\n\r\nSee the [log file with errrors](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/pygithub_requests_error/blob/master/log.txt), for [this script](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/pygithub_requests_error/blob/master/run), which runs:\r\n\r\n- a basic `curl` with the token, which succeeds ([link](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/pygithub_requests_error/blob/master/curl_test.sh))\r\n-  `PyGithub` which fails ([link](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/pygithub_requests_error/blob/master/pygithub_requests_fails.py))\r\n- `requests` which fails ([link](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/pygithub_requests_error/blob/master/requests_fails.py))\r\n- subclassed `PyGithub` with `httpx` [which succeeds](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/pygithub_requests_error/blob/a9df0bcbf91b321e068ca591e5e6b91b804fca16/log.txt#L283-L296). ([link](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/pygithub_requests_error/blob/master/httpx_subclass_succeeds.py))\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a `requests` error, since even just requesting something basic to github with the python `requests` module (without `PyGithub` at all) fails (see [`./requests_fails.py`](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/pygithub_requests_error/blob/master/requests_fails.py)), when the analogous `curl` command works fine.\r\n\r\nSo I'm not sure if this should be classified as a `PyGithub` error, or a `requests` error.\r\n\r\nSee <https://github.com/karlicoss/ghexport/issues/4#issuecomment-693694338>; in which I use `pdb` to step into right before the request is made (in `PyGithub.Requester`). If I make the request with the `requests` module, it fails. If I make it with `httpx`, it succeeds.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, I can subclass the `PyGithub.Requester` `HTTPSRequestsConnectionClass` to use [`httpx`](https://github.com/encode/httpx), and then `PyGithub` works fine. (See [`httpx_subclass_succeeds.py`](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/pygithub_requests_error/blob/master/httpx_subclass_succeeds.py) and the output [here](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/pygithub_requests_error/blob/a9df0bcbf91b321e068ca591e5e6b91b804fca16/log.txt#L283-L296)).\r\n\r\nI suspect this is an issue with `requests`, though I'm not sure how no one else has had this issue. Apologies if this should have been posted to the `requests` module instead, but I'm not sure how to debug this any further.\r\n",

When using PyGithub to make millions of GET requests over the period  of a few months we often pool the tokens of several researchers involved in the project, and use a scraper that dynamically switches tokens based on actual rate limits. \r\n\r\nHowever, writing this code is often a pain, as it requires messing with the internals of PyGithub. Recently, I started working on an update to PyGithub that allows you to pass in a list of tokens instead of a single token. Internally, PyGithub then does the switching of tokens, abstracting it away. \r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not sure if this feature is of interest to more users of PyGithub. If so, I'm open to discussing on how I could get these changes integrated into the mainline. \r\n\r\nP.S. Currently we're also running a study to help improve the sustainability of open-source communities, if you're open to performing in a single 60 minute interview on how you experience emotions when developing open-source software please let me know!",

I am loading the lists of strings from a JSON file via json.loads(), but I don't think that should make a difference since the JSON array is converted to a python list anyways.

This may also happen with other similar methods, but these are the only two I've tested.\r\n\r\nIs this a bug, or am I missing something syntax-wise here? Thanks :)",

Thanks for any hints on how to use PyGitHub for this purpose, or for pointers to existing tools that do that :-)\r\n\r\nIf none are known, would you welcome a PR with such a high-level functionality, or should it be a different tool?",

            "description": "This is both a question and a report of what I think is a design flaw. I'm trying to use PyGithub in a webapp that handles Github webhooks. I've set up a Github App for it, and am able to authenticate and perform the actions I want. However, now it is time to deal with token expiration, as Github tokens only live for an hour.\r\n\r\nThe first hurdle is that the `expires_at` property of an `InstallationAuthorization()` returns a naive datetime. Trying to assert the token is still valid is therefor problematic:\r\n```python\r\n>>> import os\r\n... import codecs\r\n... from github import Github, GithubIntegration\r\n... decoder = codecs.getdecoder(\"unicode_escape\")\r\n... PRIVATE_KEY = decoder(os.environ[\"GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY\"].encode())[0]\r\n... APP_ID = 44107\r\n... INSTALLATION_ID = 3289834\r\n... integration = GithubIntegration(APP_ID, PRIVATE_KEY)\r\n... integration_accessor = integration.get_access_token(INSTALLATION_ID)\r\n\r\n>>> integration_accessor\r\nInstallationAuthorization(expires_at=2019-10-20 09:36:48)\r\n\r\n>>> import datetime\r\n... now = datetime.datetime.now().astimezone()\r\n\r\n>>> integration_accessor.expires_at > now\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\nTypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I *naively* try to do this, the token is \"expired\" the moment I get it:\r\n```python\r\n>>> import time\r\n... integration_accessor = integration.get_access_token(INSTALLATION_ID)\r\n... now = datetime.datetime.now()\r\n... print('valid?', now < integration_accessor.expires_at)\r\n... print(now)\r\n... print(integration_accessor.expires_at)\r\nvalid? False\r\n2019-10-20 09:56:53.049639\r\n2019-10-20 09:56:53\r\n\r\n>>> now.astimezone().tzinfo\r\ndatetime.timezone(datetime.timedelta(0, 3600), 'WEST')\r\n```\r\nThat is of course because I'm in UTC+1, but would be the case for everyone in later-than-UTC timezones. So I really think `expires_at` should be a timezone-aware datetime object.\r\n\r\nBut in general, how do people handle this? Any wrapper code to check a token for being still valid out there? Or a re-auth & retry loop?",

The best way I can find to make sure my app doesn't hit the throttling limits is to keep checking before every call, and maintain a count of the number of calls made to the APIs, and then continuously checking if that limit is reached or not - while refreshing the rate limits periodically. It is not simple to implement a wrapper class, or apply decorators/descriptors to the calls because there various classes (like GitHub, Repository, Releases etc) that can make a call to the API endpoint. It seems implementing this feature inside PyGitHub to help throttle/ratelimit/wait calls would be the best approach IMO, since every call the the REST API can be tracked.

I really like its architecture,\r\nHowever, I ran into an issue or a feature of the library.\r\nI need to retrieve information about all the issues (including pull requests) in a repository. I was surprised by the low performance of the following script.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom github import Github\r\n\r\ndef load(reponame, login, password):\r\n    # Log in to GitHub (see below)\r\n    gh = Github(login, password, per_page=100)\r\n    # Define the repository: reponame=\"user/repo\"\r\n    repo = gh.get_repo(reponame)\r\n\r\n    # Create a pandas dataframe\r\n    column_names = [\"Created\", \"IsPR\"]\r\n    df_issues = pd.DataFrame(columns = column_names)\r\n\r\n    issues = repo.get_issues(state=\"all\")\r\n\r\n    for issue in issues:\r\n        df_issues.loc[issue.number] = [issue.created_at,\r\n                    issue.pull_request != None, issue.labels, issue.milestone]\r\n    \r\n    return df_issues\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe script should load up to 100 issues in one request and process them in a loop.\r\nI have noticed that while in `for issue in issues:`, the script still utilizes network.\r\n\r\nDigging into this weird behavior, it turned out, that PyGithub can send a request to GitHub if a property value is not set:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@property\r\ndef pull_request(self):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    :type: :class:`github.IssuePullRequest.IssuePullRequest`\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    \r\n    self._completeIfNotSet(self._pull_request)\r\n    if self._pull_request is NotSet:\r\n        return None\r\n    return self._pull_request.value\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo when the script fetches 100 issues, `N` of them are pull requests. For those `100-N` issues the `pull_request` property value is not set. On each such issue a network request to GitHub is performed.\r\n\r\nFor my use case these http requests are useless, significantly decrease performance and sometimes make gthub to reject the request due to rate limiting.\r\nI already have this data. required. If `self._pull_request is NotSet`, then I can safely say it is not a PR, but an issue.\r\n\r\nI have not found a way to turn off this behavior in PyGithub's API.\r\n\r\nI think there should be a way to tell, that I dont want further hidden request when acessing an item (`GithubObject`)\r\nI think there should be an option to tell if hidden requests on an object are allowed.\r\nAt the moment the `_fetchNextPage` function of `PaginatedList` sets all items as not completed:\r\n```\r\nself.__contentClass(self.__requester, headers, element, completed=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\nA workaround might be to use `get_pulls` to retrieve all pull requests, but then the data is retrieved again, although it is already present when retreiving issues.",

Has anyone implemented authorization as follows:\r\n\r\nuser authenticates with github username and password\r\nToken is created in their account via pygithub\r\nToken string is accessed via pygithub\r\n\r\nMost of the examples start with the user providing the login credentials or the token string. but i'd like to create the string via the api and then access it.\r\n\r\nThank you for any guidance!\r\n",

However, if I manually print the login value, I will get the expected result.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> auth_user = git.get_user()\r\n>>> print(auth_user)\r\nAuthenticatedUser(login=None)\r\n\r\n>> print(auth_user.login)\r\ndragosdumitrache\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suspect the issue might be because the `__repr__` method on `AuthenticatedUser` directly references the login value: `self._login.value`, instead of using the property `login()`. However, this is just a guess on my end, since I couldn't run the code locally.\r\n\r\nRegarding local development, I am using Python 3.7.3, and the project only seems compatible with python2, is that correct? I'm asking so that in the future I can be more useful than just raising issues :)\r\n\r\nL.E: Seems to print the correct representation if I manually check the `login` value and then print the entire object.\r\n```py\r\n>>> print(auth_user.login)\r\ndragosdumitrache\r\n>>> print(auth_user)\r\nAuthenticatedUser(login=dragosdumitrache)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as it relates to `AuthenticatedUser`, is there a reason why `AuthenticatedUser` would not be equal to the equivalent `NamedUser`?

For example before I was testing with the REQUESTS package (as shown below) and there was a way to set the proxy:\r\nimport requests \r\nproxies = { \r\n'http':'http://proxy.mycompany.corp:8080', \r\n'https': 'https://proxy.mycompany.corp:8080', \r\n}\r\nr = requests.get('https://github.mylabs.com.au/iagcl/iag-edh-data/pulls', proxies = proxies)\r\n\r\nIf you please advise me how to do similar thing with the PyGithub would be great... Thanks again ...\r\n",

If you see `Framework` to be potentially reused by 3rd party packages like ours, and if you insist that no `tests/` shipped as part of the `github` package, may be it makes sense then to move `Framework` components to e.g. `github.testing` (analogous to `numpy.testing` etc)?",

            "description": "### Description\r\n\r\n**Version**: 1.43.5\r\n\r\nThe `get_git_ref` function doesn't handle the case where `ref` is not found, but other refs prefixed by `ref` exist. The `get_git_ref` function should either return a list of `GitRefs` in this case or raise `UnknownObjectException`.\r\n\r\nFrom the [documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/git/refs/):\r\n\r\n> If the ref doesn't exist in the repository, but existing refs start with ref they will be returned as an array. For example, a call to get the data for a branch named feature, which doesn't exist, would return head refs including featureA and featureB which do.\r\n\r\n### Demonstration\r\n\r\nSingle object returned when ref exists, as expected:\r\n```py\r\nIn [23]: ref = repo.get_git_ref('tags/bar')\r\n\r\nIn [24]: ref\r\nOut[24]: GitRef(ref=\"refs/tags/bar\")\r\n\r\nIn [25]: ref._rawData\r\nOut[25]:\r\n{'node_id': 'MDM6UmVmNTE5NjI3MzpiYXI=',\r\n 'object': {'sha': '70ed626e0fec6d033b5066a322ce77565e67f0ff',\r\n  'type': 'commit',\r\n  'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/repo/www/git/commits/70ed626e0fec6d033b5066a322ce77565e67f0ff'},\r\n 'ref': 'refs/tags/bar',\r\n 'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/repo/www/git/refs/tags/bar'}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\"Null\" ref returned when ref not found, but multiple prefix matches found:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nIn [26]: ref = repo.get_git_ref('heads/bar')\r\n\r\nIn [27]: ref\r\nOut[27]: GitRef(ref=None)\r\n\r\nIn [28]: ref._rawData\r\nOut[28]:\r\n[{'node_id': 'MDM6UmVmNTE5NjI3MzpiYXJfMQ==',\r\n  'object': {'sha': '70ed626e0fec6d033b5066a322ce77565e67f0ff',\r\n   'type': 'commit',\r\n   'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/repo/www/git/commits/70ed626e0fec6d033b5066a322ce77565e67f0ff'},\r\n  'ref': 'refs/heads/bar_1',\r\n  'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/repo/www/git/refs/heads/bar_1'},\r\n {'node_id': 'MDM6UmVmNTE5NjI3MzpiYXJfMg==',\r\n  'object': {'sha': 'baf8b0ebbe4c9974a6a255557efd61f2c51751e3',\r\n   'type': 'commit',\r\n   'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/repo/www/git/commits/baf8b0ebbe4c9974a6a255557efd61f2c51751e3'},\r\n  'ref': 'refs/heads/bar_2',\r\n  'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/repo/www/git/refs/heads/bar_2'}]\r\n```\r\n### Conclusion\r\nI understand this is an edge case, but most people probably don't expect to ever receive a \"null\" ref in this case. The least surprising thing to do here may be to raise `UnknownObjectException` if there is no exact match for `ref`. Additionally, there may be value in providing a flag to return prefix match results instead of throwing an exception.\r\n",

In the current API, [POST will only *add*, never remove](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/branches/#add-team-restrictions-of-protected-branch). This commit adds a more fine-grained API:\r\n\r\n* `add_user|team_push_restrictions` (`POST`)\r\n* `replace_user|team_push_restrictions` (`PUT`)\r\n* `remove_user|team_push_restrictions` (`DELETE`)\r\n\r\n`replace_user|team_push_restriction` could also be called `edit_user|team_push_restriction` but I find the name slightly misleading. It also can't safely replace the old `edit_user|team_push_restriction` functions as those would have only ever added users or teams.\r\n\r\nThe way this PR is built right now, it's a breaking change. Advice and opinions on alternative approaches are welcome.",

During a search_repository call, it sometime returns all repositories which is fine, and few minutes later it return a list with some repositories missing.\r\nHere is a log output to be able to visualize where issue lies:\r\n\r\n```\r\n10:02:44  Iterate through all github repositories found with query: github.search_repository(query_string)\r\n\r\n10:02:45 github repository list  ['si_test2', 'si_test3', 'si_github', 'si_ece', **'si_test1'**, 'si_test5', 'si_circleci-automate', 'si_ece-ami-factory', 'si_aws-sam-skeleton', 'si_training_account_mgmt']\r\n\r\n10:04:44 Iterate through all github repositories found with query: github.search_repository(query_string)\r\n\r\n10:04:45 github repository list ['si_test3', 'si_test2', 'si_test5', 'si_circleci-automate', 'si_aws-sam-skeleton', 'si_ece-ami-factory', 'si_training_account_mgmt']\r\n\r\n10:06:44 Iterate through all github repositories found with query: github.search_repository(query_string)\r\n\r\n10:06:44 github repository list ['si_test2', 'si_test3', 'si_github', 'si_ece', **'si_test1'**, 'si_test5', 'si_circleci-automate', 'si_ece-ami-factory', 'si_aws-sam-skeleton', 'si_training_account_mgmt']\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that at \r\n10:02:45 si_test1 repository was found in the returned list.\r\n10:04:45 si_test1 repository not found in the list\r\n10:06:44 si_test1 was again found in the list\r\n\r\nAs i mentioned, this happens sporadically and si_test1 repository was never deleted during the 3 api calls.\r\nCould someone help me understand this? Or is there a better was to search for repositories and get a consistent set of result.\r\n",

Should this be `parent_team` and take a `Team` object? I feel like developers shouldn't have to create a `Team` instance just to set the parent id. However,\r\n  * There are plenty examples for one or the other. On the same method the parameter `repo_names`, which by name kind of implies `Sequence[str]` is then asserted to be of type `Sequence[Repository]`.\r\n  * immediately below it, `delete_hook` takes an `int` id as its parameter and not a `Hook` object.\r\n\r\nI could use some opinions or guidance on that.",

Fetched them with `pr.as_issue().get_events()` where `pr` is a `PullRequest` object. I am then filtering `labeled` events, and want to look up the label name.\r\n\r\nSo I use `event.label.name` where `event` is an `IssueEvent` object.\r\n\r\nWith PyGithub 1.43.3 for hundreds of events this goes fine. For a small number of events in the same repository this raises an `AttributeError`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  File \"/home/xxx/lib/python3.6/site-packages/github/IssueEvent.py\", line 125, in label\r\n    self._completeIfNotSet(self._label)\r\nAttributeError: 'IssueEvent' object has no attribute '_label'\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotably, with 1.40.x this failed for most (all?) of the events. So, things vastly improved in release 1.43.3, but seemingly pull/857 might not have addressed all edge cases.\r\n\r\nI looked at the raw data, at the raw HTTP response, but could not find the decisive difference between \"good\" events and \"bad\" events. However, for those events where the `event.label.name` lookup fails the raw data is actually *good*, and I could work around the problem by using `event._rawData['label']['name']`. Which suggests that this is actually a bug in the code.\r\n\r\nFor an example for a \"bad\" event, I hope to have the relevant details here:\r\n`pprint(vars(event))` yields:\r\n```\r\n{'_CompletableGithubObject__completed': False,\r\n '_actor': <github.GithubObject._ValuedAttribute object at 0x7f8147b19a58>,\r\n '_commit_id': <github.GithubObject._ValuedAttribute object at 0x7f8147b21320>,\r\n '_created_at': <github.GithubObject._ValuedAttribute object at 0x7f8147b21358>,\r\n '_event': <github.GithubObject._ValuedAttribute object at 0x7f8147b213c8>,\r\n '_headers': {'access-control-allow-origin': '*',\r\n              'access-control-expose-headers': 'ETag, Link, Location, '\r\n                                               'Retry-After, X-GitHub-OTP, '\r\n                                               'X-RateLimit-Limit, '\r\n                                               'X-RateLimit-Remaining, '\r\n                                               'X-RateLimit-Reset, '\r\n                                               'X-OAuth-Scopes, '\r\n                                               'X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes, '\r\n                                               'X-Poll-Interval, '\r\n                                               'X-GitHub-Media-Type',\r\n              'cache-control': 'private, max-age=60, s-maxage=60',\r\n              'content-encoding': 'gzip',\r\n              'content-security-policy': \"default-src 'none'\",\r\n              'content-type': 'application/json;

            "description": "# Problem\r\n\r\n`Authorization` header is overwritten by `.netrc` even if I set `login_or_token` in `github.Github`.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Add entry for github.com in `~/.netrc`\r\n2. Construct `Github` with different config than `~/.netrc`: `gh = Github(token)`\r\n3. Make any request\r\n\r\n# Cause\r\n\r\nSince v1.40, PyGithub start using [**requests**](https://github.com/requests/requests) library for http requesting (see #664).\r\n\r\nIn **requests**, `auth` attribute  of session or requests is the primary way of authenticate. If no `auth` set, `.netrc` file is used and 'Authorization' header is overwritten.\r\n\r\nHowever, PyGithub authenticates requests by simply adding 'Authorization' header in `Requester.__authenticate`, which is not the way **requests** library expected.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nDefined custom authentication function which uses `.netrc` file if-and-only-if `Authorization` header isn't set already.\r\n\r\n## Other possible, but declined solution\r\n\r\n### Set `trust_env=False`\r\n\r\nThis is [the official way to ignore `.netrc`](https://github.com/requests/requests/issues/2773), but it disables `.netrc` at all even when no token specified, and also disables proxy handling.\r\n\r\n### Use custom authentication to set `Authorization` header.\r\n\r\nThis seems the cleaner way when using only **requests** library.\r\n\r\nHowever, PyGithub's `Requester` support injection of http client, and the above method won't work for injected non-**requests** client.",

However, I receive a `404 Not found` response when trying to update or delete this file.\r\n\r\nMy first guess is that the bug comes from the way the URL is build in the `Repository.py` module.

            "description": "This PR is related to #757 and #378\r\n\r\nThis is an attempt to add a communications retry feature into PyGithub that can be user defined at the top level.\r\n\r\nThis works directly with requests and uses the low level urllib3 Retry object (already used by requests) to implement the functionality.  It is backwards compatible with the current codeset.\r\n\r\nThe user can set the retry parameter in the top level `github(<login>, retry = X)` call.  Where X can be a simple `int` to define the number of retrys or it can be an `urllib3.util.retry.Retry(...)` object.  This allows the user very fine grained control over the retry system as defined by urllib3.\r\n\r\nThe structure for the Retry object can be setup like this example:\r\n```\r\nnum_retries=3\r\nbackoff_factor=5\r\nstatus_forcelist=(500, 502, 504)\r\nretry_data = urllib3.util.retry.Retry(\r\n                                      total=num_retries,\r\n                                      read=num_retries,\r\n                                      connect=num_retries,\r\n                                      backoff_factor=backoff_factor,\r\n                                      status_forcelist=status_forcelist\r\n                                     )\r\ngserver = github(<login or token>, retry = retry_data)\r\n```\r\nThe urllib3 Retry object has many parameters, that allows the user much flexibility to configure retry's to their heart's content.\r\n\r\nThe only issue I have at the moment, is that I am completely baffled on how to add tests for this feature given the current testing infrastructure.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nCC: @mfonville @jrouquie @sfdye \r\n\r\nEDIT: The code for this PR is now stale, and is being moved forward via PR #1002.

            "description": "This is mostly @peterkline's work, just trying to replace #635 (which hasn't been updated) and adjust for some of the changes requested / discussed there.\r\n\r\nThis seems to resolves the existing test failure, and I think resolves most of the other feedback in the other PR. It also switches the input to `replace_topics()` to the expected array as discussed. Would appreciate feedback, esp. on the test case I added. Because there's no expected return from the method, I think that test is acceptable as-is? I'm not that familiar with this module's test setup, though, so let me know if I should update anything.\r\n\r\nI didn't have much luck rebasing, so I just patched, but I did retain original author on the first commit.\r\ncc @sfdye ",

This error led me to believe that my app did not have the correct permissions. However, I tried giving it read & write permissions (when possible) to every element, and still I am faced with this error. **Am I perhaps passing the wrong type of token when I instantiate `pygit` or is this an issue with PyGithub?**\r\n\r\nOther methods, such as [`get_repo(\"REPO_NAME\")`](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/github_objects/NamedUser.html#github.NamedUser.NamedUser.get_repo), work as intended and without error. Furthermore, when I run:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfor method in dir(user):\r\n    print(method)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can see the `get_repos` method, so I am certain that it should be callable from this object.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I can provide any further information, and thanks in advance for any help.",

This fixes that.\r\n- Fix some Python 3 troubles while recording\r\n- Add a `replayDataFolder` gloval class variable, to override the default place to put the recording. Otherwise, if a third party app (like mine :)) has a dependency on PyGithub and wants to use the Framework, recordings are saved in `site-packages/github/tests/ReplayData` instead of my own place.\r\n\r\nHope this helps, please let me know if I can improve the PR.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

There are two issues here:\r\n\r\nFirstly, PullRequest.get_reviewer_requests() passes a list_item of 'users' in, which means any information under teams is not returned. If we drop that, it's an API break, since we will return a dict('users': PaginatedList, 'teams': PaginatedList) rather than a PaginatedList directly. We could work around that by adding PullRequest.get_team_reviewer_requests(), but then it's two methods users have to call, which feels awkward.\r\n\r\nSecondly, and more importantly, PullRequestReviewerRequest does not support teams -- the simplest solution here is to add a slug property to the class, and if slug is set, it's a team, otherwise it's a user, but this just feels awkward. We could subclass it, along with polishing the API to return the user and team object directly rather than just the identifier, but that has issues too.\r\n\r\nI wanted to get opinions on the way forward before I got too deep into writing code.",

If you are not yet familiar with secure source code signing I recommend using [GPGit](https://github.com/NicoHood/gpgit) which automates the process of secure source code signing and also has a quick start guide on GPG for learning how to use it manually.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.",

So for example, if you're in the United States and pass a `date` object like `date(2018, 2, 4)`, then GitHub will interpret that as 2018-02-04T00:00:00Z which is actually 2018-02-03 in the United States.  So the due date in the milestone will be the day before the one you passed in.  This is incorrect behavior.\r\n\r\nSince GitHub API needs expects a date/time in ISO 8601 format, it would be best to pass in a `datetime` object and call `.isoformat()` on the object, than to bother with `date` objects.  This will also be more compatible with enhanced datetime libraries like [pendulum](https://pendulum.eustace.io/).",

This is more consistent with python NoneType usage, and produces the correct json encoded output for the http request body.  \r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n- updates the assignment of `encoded_input` to `NoneType`\r\n- updates checks in `Framework.py` to allow for a NoneType input var\r\n- Fixes all tests for this change, largely by updating the data files from null to None, which is commonly used in test asserts.  \r\n\r\n***Additional details on the NoneType fix***\r\nExample output in my application:\r\n```\r\n>>> github_client =  github.Github(login_or_token=pat, base_url=ghe_url)\r\n>>> org = github_client.get_organization(org_name)\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"github/MainClass.py\", line 198, in get_organization\r\n    \"/orgs/\" + login\r\n  File \"github/Requester.py\", line 172, in requestJsonAndCheck\r\n    return self.__check(*self.requestJson(verb, url, parameters, headers, input, cnx))\r\n  File \"github/Requester.py\", line 180, in __check\r\n    raise self.__createException(status, responseHeaders, output)\r\ngithub.GithubException.GithubException: 400 {'data': ****retracted****}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe root cause of my 400 error is somewhat related to a proxy in my enterprise application checking the JSON-encoded form.  The valid json type is null, not 'null'.  \r\n\r\nSince `Requestor.py` actually uses the output of `json.dumps(encoded_input)` the default value should be NoneType, because string 'null' actually produces an extra set of quotes, e.g:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> out = json.dumps('null')\r\n>>> print out\r\n\"null\"\r\n>>> print out[0]\r\n\"\r\n>>> out2 = json.dumps(None)\r\n>>> print out2\r\nnull\r\n>>> print out2[0]\r\nn\r\n```",

Say I just want the class to be able to get the number of \"uniques.\" I have this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Clone(github.GithubObject.CompletableGithubObject):\r\n    def __repr__(self):\r\n        return self.get__repr__({\"uniques\": self._uniques.value})\r\n\r\n    @property\r\n    def uniques(self):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        :type: integer\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        return self._uniques.value\r\n\r\n    def _initAttributes(self):\r\n        self._uniques = github.GithubObject.NotSet\r\n\r\n    def _useAttributes(self, attributes):\r\n        if \"uniques\" in attributes:\r\n            self._uniques = self._makeIntAttribute(attributes[\"uniques\"])\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when I test it by creating a clone object, it fails with: \r\n    **self._uniques = self._makeIntAttribute(attributes[\"uniques\"])\r\n    TypeError: string indices must be integers**\r\n\r\nWhat am I missing? Just jumping into this; can't admit that I know if, for instance, Clones should be a \"CompletableGithubObject,\" the nuances of the nested clone information, etc. I'd like to get the basics of this working though and contribute to PyGithub however.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n",

            "description": "### The problem so far\r\n\r\nAs reported in #404 and #439, the Github official API now supports multiple assignees (along with Enterprise edition since v2.7).\r\nHowever, PyGithub doesn't support it yet.\r\n\r\n### How it's solved\r\n\r\n1. Added the `assignees` attribute to the `Issue` object (e0e5fdf9c06be34d580aeca4829e7d53757bce89)\r\n    - In older version of API which doesn't support multiple assignees, `Issue.assignees` returns just a single-element list of `Issue.assignee`.\r\n2. Enhance support of `assignees` argument in `Issue.edit()` (14dd9f0850f4f280fd7bdb354860c88c5ca7356b)\r\n    - Some work have done in #466 already, but it now accepts a list of `github.Nameduser.NamedUser`.\r\n3. Added `assignees` argument in `Repository.create_issue()` (ba007dc8a8bb5d5fdf75706db84dab6a69929d7d)\r\n4. Added the `assignees` attribute also to the `PullRequest` object. (c0de6be5ea7d285f110ba82bb96bf6fe80b01945)\r\n    - Following the [comment](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/pull/469#issuecomment-261708142) from @andrzejchm, added the `assignees` attribute to `PullRequest` object as well. The diff is same as the first commit.\r\n5. Added the `add_to_assignees` and the `remove_from_assignees` methods to the `Issue` object. (66430d7831aa31beb726efa4a3ea25f2c7950819)\r\n    - Following the [comment](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/pull/469#issuecomment-262274782) from @mgorny, added the `add_to_assignees` and the `remove_from_assignees` methods to the `Issue` object, each of which utilizes [the \"add assignees to an issue\" API](https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/assignees/#add-assignees-to-an-issue) API and [the \"remove assignees from an issue\" API](https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/assignees/#remove-assignees-from-an-issue) respectively.\r\n    - These methods are to modify assignees on an issue without changing the existing assignees. To set assignees ignoring the existing assignees or to clear all assignees, use `edit` method like `issue.edit(assignees=['user1', 'user2'])` or `issue.edit(assignees=[])`.\r\n\r\n### Note for maintainers\r\n\r\nAll of the `ReplayData` is edited manually by my hand, since I could not edit issues on this repo.\r\nIf that is problematic, feel free to overwrite them!",

Instead, I've used the _wonderful_ httplib.\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n``` python\r\nfrom github import GithubIntegration, Github\r\n\r\n# obtained during integration creation\r\nprivate_key = \"some private key\"\r\nintegration_id = 123\r\n\r\n# obtained when a user installs the integration (webhook)\r\ninstallation_id = 456\r\n\r\n# get a token\r\nintegration = GithubIntegration(integration_id, private_key)\r\nauth = integration.get_access_token(installation_id)\r\n\r\ngh = GitHub(auth.token)\r\nrepo = gh.get_repo(\"user/whatever\")\r\n```\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nNone, yet. Integrations are in early access right now. I think it's safe to add tests once the API is stable.\r\n### Added dependencies\r\n\r\nIn order to create the JSON web token, this PR adds [python-jose](https://github.com/mpdavis/python-jose). Another candidate is [pyjwt](https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt), but that isn't installable on Google Compute Engine.\r\n",

We did this because collecting data on PRs was getting difficult with 2 possible objects to look for information in. The PR obj contains lots of helpful info but doesn't contain the \"Labels\" or \"comments\" that aren't inline comments. These are contained in the \"Issue\" obj.\n\nSo my question/suggestion is would it be too much to add a sort of \"super class\" that would be a PR_ISSUE object that could contain a combination of the two together so that collecting multiple objects are not required? If this is just and insane idea and other people have implemented other ways to handle this we would love to hear about them. We understand that it's just a few calls to github but with our scripts we are making a lot of calls at once and hitting our max limits quickly. Any suggestions are very helpful and we would also be willing to contribute to the community as well. Thanks.\n\nMatt Babineau \nRelease Engineer\nDataXu\n\nhttps://github.com/dataxu/github-pr\n",

PyGithub made this easy and fun.  But then I ran up against the rate limit.  I can slow things down and spread copy work over some hours; so there's that.\n\nI don't think it matters to what follows but I'm adding fields for things like priority, and adding a more complex set of states an issue can move thru.  Those are derived from labels on the issues.  From time to time I fetch recent events and if is issue related I regenerate it's entry in my db; so I don't need to do a full copy that often.   My db is designed so i can discard it at any time and regenerate it - at the cost of a few hours.  Imperfections mean that happens: a) I'm imperfect, and b) at least one change to an issue doesn't generate an event.\n\nAll my report generation runs without contacting github.  I have one script that contacts github which can bootstrap my db, update it, and make misc. updates that arise out of the housekeeping.\n\nReading #26 was interesting.\n\nI noticed update,save and load methods, and thinking of ways to make the full copy less rate limited.\n\nI figured the scan that does the copy could check a cache of pickles (key'd by URL), and use 'em + update to reduce the load.   So I cheerfully went off and built my cache of pickled issues.\n\nThe scan is roughly:\n\n``` python\nfor github_issue in repo.get_issues(state=u'all'):\n    digest(github_issue)\n```\n\nNaively I now yearn to write `repo.get_urls_of_issues(state_u'all')`\n\nThe wonder of pygithub is that I really didn't need to read the github doc at all; but I feel there may well be more to this.  For example how deep is the save/load?  Do I have to cache users, milestones, label objects too?  If so patching the restored objects looks tedious.\n\nIn more grandiose thinking ... it might be possible ... to plumb a mode into pygit that always has a cache of pickled objects and which try those+update whenever possible.  Looking at the fetching code made it clear that I shouldn't try to do that and I really ought to get back to the real work.\n",

You may want to reach them for confirmation. If this is the case, I can't see any reliable workaround. You would need repeatedly get the PR until `mergeable` is not `null` anymore...

My original question was something to the effect of \"is there a way to get a repo by its id rather than its name?\" The motivation for this is, while a repo's name can change, its id cannot.\n\nTo summarize what James said:\n\n> We haven't documented this yet, however you've welcome to use repository endpoints like this:\n> \n> /repositories/:id\n> \n> For example, these two curls produce identical results:\n> \n> curl https://api.github.com/repos/github/linguist\n> curl https://api.github.com/repositories/1725199\n> \n> These should eventually be documented, however I can't promise exactly when that will be. However, you can definitely rely on these endpoints.\n\nThis also works with private repos, provided an access token is included in the request and the user has sufficient permissions.\n\nAs far as I can tell, this functionality is not provided in PyGithub. James indicated that this will eventually be documented and is a stable endpoint, so I think it should be included in the library.\n\nExamples of how I think this should work:\n\n``` python\ngh = github.Github('my_access_token')\nrepo = gh.get_user().get_repo(1234567)\nrepo = gh.get_repo(1234567)\n```\n\nThe only issue I see with this is that `get_repo` would be delegating to one of two endpoints, `/repos/:owner/:repo` or `/repositories/:id`, depending on whether a name or an id is passed in. The other option would be to have an explicit `get_repo_by_id` which seems less ideal.\n\nI'm hoping to work on a PR when I get a chance this week.\n\nThoughts, @jacquev6?\n",

Both 2 branches solve the issue of how to introduce **response header** information into `GithubObjects`, which is currently discarded but necessary for unsupported GitHub API such as [Conditional Request](http://developer.github.com/guides/getting-started/#conditional-requests). \n\nWhile PR #189 aiming at reducing changes made to the source tree, this branch is more drastic. The signature of `GithubObject`'s constructor is changed to:\n\n``` python\ndef __init__(self, requester, headers, attributes, completed):\n        # ...\n```\n\nThus enforces initialization with header information and exposes all constructor call for modification. That reduces the chance of introduction bugs from human error such as forget to set header values, comparing to more simple solution such as introducing a simple `@property`. \n\nAll constructor calls are resolved to new signature incrementally and thoroughly tested along the way. The chances of introducing bugs are low (if there are any, it should only affect new features involving response headers).\n\nNew testing code for headers are also implemented by hooking up callbacks between `GithubObject` and `Requester` class. Thus every constructor call can be intercepted for assertion. \n\nAlthough this would be a more permanent solution, the downside is obvious for the relatively large amount of changes. But I think in the long run it's worth this trouble and would be better to solve any conflicts before introducing new features involving response headers.\n",

For this, I suspect `get_page` won't even work on `Github.get_users` because pagination of this API is specific.

There are a couple of options:\n- Incorporate one of the snippets running around the web (e.g. [http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577548-https-httplib-client-connection-with-certificate-v/](this one from ActiveState); see also [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3280603/adding-server-certificate-validation-to-httplib-httpsconnection](this StackOverflow discussion).\n- Switch to [http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/](Requests), and add a dependency on it and urllib3.\n- Switch to [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/urllib3](urllib3), on which Requests is based, and add a dependency upon it.\n- Switch to [http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/](httplib2), and add a dependency on it.\n- Switch to [http://pycurl.sourceforge.net/](PyCurl), and add a dependency on it.\n\nSome of these (especially Requests) are significantly higher-level than the current httplib approach, so they'd be a fair amount of change. I think httplib2 would probably be the smallest change of them all, and lots of people are likely to have it due to having Requests installed.\n\nThe first approach would avoid an external dependency when on Python 2.6 and up, but there's no `ssl` module in older versions of Python, so it'd bring in a dependency on M2Crypto, if those versions are still worth supporting.\n\nDo you have opinions on which route you prefer?

Adding external dependencies is not a problem as long as `pip install PyGithub` installs them. And by the way, dropping support of Python 2.5 seems acceptable now if we have a good reason :-)\n\nI think @thouis has already tried to switch to Requests: https://github.com/thouis/PyGithub/commit/aab96401054c551aebf1abd2649a6a5aef65e931 I have really not checked his work, and this is based on a quite old version of PyGithub, so it may or may not be a good idea to base your work on it.\n\nOne difficult aspect of this migration will be the record-replay test framework, which is really hard-coded with httplib.

Just write what would have been useful for you when you discovered PyGithub. Also, you could improve the [reference documentation](http://jacquev6.github.com/PyGithub) (generated from the [doc strings](https://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub/blob/master/github/MainClass.py#L39))\n\nIf you're not into documentation, there has been some recent [API changes](http://developer.github.com/changes/). I will not have time to analyze them soon, because I'm in vacations, so you can check their impact on PyGithub. There are also missing functionalities around [notifications](http://developer.github.com/changes/2012-10-26-notifications-api/) and [specific exceptions](https://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues/152)\n\nJust choose what you like and tell me you're working on it, so we don't do twice the same thing.\n\nAnd if you need help, do not hesitate to ask.\n\nCheers!\n"

Hence, about 1/3 of the available data is being returned on lots of requests\n\nIs there a reason not to go ahead and add a default per_page=100 to all API requests? Best case, it results in faster access to data, and worst case, it has no effect. For my particular uses, I'm making lots of requests, and a speedup of ~3.3x would be a big help.\n\nThoughts?\n",

Indeed, PyGithub has evolved (and stabilized).\n\nMethods that used to return a list of objects now return a `PaginatedList`. `PaginatedList` instances are only iterable (They do not support concatenation as lists do, and you cannot call `len` on them).\n\nThe rationale behind that? It is related to issue #33 and requests returning a large number of objects. In the previous version, creating a list of all the requested objects required a lot of [pagination requests](http://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination), and was quite long. It was a waste of time if the user was interested only in the first elements of that list. Enters `PaginatedList`, which does the pagination requests only when really needed. And it is no more limited to 10 pages.\n\nSo, to achieve what your are trying to do, you have to iterate the `PaginatedList` explicitly, either in a loop, or in the constructor of another collection.\n\nSimple iteration:\n\n```\nfor issue in itertools.chain(\n        repo.get_issues( state = 'closed' ),\n        repo.get_issues( state = 'open' )\n):\n    do stuff\n```\n\nReal list from PaginatedList (and then you can have its length):\n\n```\nissues = list( repo.get_issues( state = 'closed' ) ) + list( repo.get_issues( state = 'open' ) )\nnb_issues = len( issues )\n```\n"
